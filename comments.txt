Placing Phase:
After playing the placing phase ourselves, we have decided that the best strategy is simply one where your pieces do not die.
The more pieces you are left with at the start of the Moving Phase, the better positioned you are to take as many of your 
opponents pieces as possible. That being said, if there are opportunities to take your opponents pieces during the Placing
Phase, you shouldn't miss the chance, but should ensure your pieces won't die in the process. Due to this, we have designed
our decision making in four parts:
          1. Firstly, as our first priority is to keep our pieces alive, check if there are any of our
             pieces in imminent danger, and if so, place a piece in the position our opponent would use
             to kill the piece in danger, as long as it is safe to do so.
          2. Secondly, the idea of the game is to kill all your opponents pieces by flanking, so that is
             our second priority. If there are any positions that will instantly kill an opponent piece
             and are reasonably safe positions, place a piece there.
          3. Thirdly, we wish to place our pieces in strategic positions. If we place our piece two spaces
             away from an opponent, not only is it safe, but we can place another piece between the two, 
             safely placing a piece next to an opponent so we can kill it without being at risk of being
             killed ourselves. (visually, O - @ to O O @ configuration)
          4. Lastly, if none of the above strategies can safely be executed, we want to place pieces in 
             positions that won't get them killed. Therefore, we will choose a random position, check 
             whether it is safe, and place the piece there if it is, or else choose another position 
             until it matches our constraints.
